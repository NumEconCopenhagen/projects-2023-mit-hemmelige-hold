# Data analysis project

My project is titled Municipality movers and their effect on average age in Denmark and is about the movement patterns of Danes between municipalities and its effect on average age in municipalities.

The figures, correlations and maps of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

I use data from the DST API and the geojson file kommuner.geojson that is provided in the repository:


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations: Geopandas and pydst

%pip install geopandas
%pip install pydst

I also use the packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and ipywidgets for the interactive map
