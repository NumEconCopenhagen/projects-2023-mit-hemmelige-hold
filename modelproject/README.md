# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Dynamics of the Ramsey model with taxation**. In the project i extend the basic Ramsey model introduced in the lectures with government spending and taxation. I solve the dynamic Ramsey model numericly. 

The results of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires SimpleNamespace, numpy and optimize.
